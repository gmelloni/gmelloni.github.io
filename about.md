My name is Giorgio, I am currently a Research Scientist at the [TIMI Study Group](https://timi.org/) at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and an Associate Scientist at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT for the [Ellinor Lab](https://www.ellinorlab.org/).

I started a blog, let's see how it goes :)
