My name is Giorgio, I am currently a Research Scientist 
at the [TIMI Study Group](https://timi.org/) at the Brigham and Women's Hospital 
in Boston and an Associate Scientist at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT 
for the [Ellinor Lab](https://www.ellinorlab.org/).

I used to just post my **[publications](./publications.md)** and **[projects](./projects.md)** 
here, but I decided to start writing a 
data science **[blog](./blog.md)** too. Let's see how far it goes :)
